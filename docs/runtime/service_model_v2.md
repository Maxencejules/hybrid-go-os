# Service Model v2

Date: 2026-03-09  
Milestone: M25 Userspace Service Model + Init v2  
Service Model ID: `rugo.service_model.v2`  
Dependency order schema: `rugo.service_dependency_order.v2`  
Lifecycle report schema: `rugo.service_lifecycle_report.v2`  
Restart report schema: `rugo.restart_policy_report.v2`

## Purpose

Define deterministic userspace service lifecycle behavior for startup, shutdown,
failure handling, and restart decisions.

The live default Go lane now exercises this model with `timesvc`, `diagsvc`,
`pkgsvc`, and `shell` on the real `go_test` boot path.

## Lifecycle states

Services move through these states only:

- `declared`
- `blocked` (waiting for dependencies)
- `starting`
- `running`
- `failed`
- `stopping`
- `stopped`

Any transition outside this state machine is a contract violation.

## Startup and shutdown order

Deterministic startup rule: topological dependency order, then lexical service
name.

Deterministic shutdown rule: reverse startup order.

Dependency cycles are invalid and must fail plan generation before service
activation begins.

## Failure propagation rules

- If a dependency is not `running`, dependent services remain `blocked`.
- Failure of a `critical` dependency blocks `operational` state.
- Failure of a `best-effort` service does not block `operational` state.

## Restart policy contract

Supported policies:

- `never`
- `on-failure`
- `always`

Bounded restart controls:

- Maximum restart attempts per window: `3`.
- Restart window seconds: `60`.
- Backoff sequence seconds: `1, 2, 4`.

If the cap is reached, the service transitions to `failed` and remains stopped
until a manual recovery action.

## Runtime service contract fields

Each declared service may also carry:

- a startup phase (`core` or `services`)
- a bounded startup budget before the manager declares the service wedged
- an optional stop command for controlled shutdown

The default Go lane uses those fields to:

- reach `operational` only after the `core` phase is healthy
- emit deterministic wedge markers instead of waiting forever in `starting`
- apply per-service scheduler class through `sys_sched_set`
- request orderly shutdown of remaining services after the shell completes
- expose kernel-backed task snapshots through `diagsvc` and `sys_proc_info`
- enforce a storage-only isolation profile on the shipped `pkgsvc` path

## Enforcement

- Local gate: `make test-userspace-model-v2`
- CI gate: `Userspace model v2 gate`

Required M25 checks:

- `tests/runtime/test_service_model_docs_v2.py`
- `tests/runtime/test_service_lifecycle_v2.py`
- `tests/runtime/test_service_boot_runtime_v2.py`
- `tests/runtime/test_service_dependency_order_v2.py`
- `tests/runtime/test_restart_policy_v2.py`
- `tests/runtime/test_userspace_model_gate_v2.py`

Runtime-backed default-lane evidence:

- `tests/runtime/test_service_boot_runtime_v2.py` boots `make image-go` and
  verifies manifest-driven lifecycle markers from the real TinyGo init/service
  path rather than only deterministic models.
- The live boot path now reaps exited service tasks through `sys_wait` and
  exercises bounded restart on the default shell service before the successful
  run reaches `ready`.
- The same boot path now launches `diagsvc`, services a live diagnostic request
  from `shell`, and performs bounded stop control on the remaining services.
- The same boot path now launches `pkgsvc`, serves a live package/update flow,
  and proves its storage-backed isolation profile on the shipped image.
- The service manager now applies explicit scheduler class to each spawned
  service, and `diagsvc` snapshots kernel task identity/state/accounting from
  the live booted system.
