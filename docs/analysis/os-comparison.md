# Rugo OS Comparison (Evidence-Based)
Date: 2026-03-11 (repo evidence refreshed; external comparison sources last accessed 2026-03-04)

## Executive Summary
- Rugo is currently an x86-64 hybrid OS with a Rust `no_std` kernel and Go user-space services, booting through Limine, with an explicit legacy C lane preserved as a reference baseline and a documented hardware support-claim model for virtual-platform and bare-metal classes.[R1][R2][R3][R24][R25][R26]
- The active Rugo lane reports M0-M47 and G1-G2 as done, with the latest completed hardware expansion phase recorded as M45-M47 and closed with deterministic claim-promotion and support-tier audit gates.[R1][R2][R3]
- Rugo's syscall ABI v0 is explicitly documented, includes a freeze window, and locks syscall numbering and semantics for syscalls `0..17` during that window.[R6]
- Linux kernel documentation shows a mature scheduler model (CFS/vruntime/rbtree), hierarchical page-table VM model, a unified driver model, and explicit long-term userspace API expectations (including syscall stability guidance).[E1][E2][E3][E4][E5][E6][E7]
- Linux distributions in this comparison are primarily differentiated by package/update mechanics: APT (`Debian`, `Ubuntu`), DNF (`Fedora`), pacman (`Arch`), declarative Nix model (`NixOS`), and Portage/emerge (`Gentoo`).[E8][E9][E10][E11][E12][E13][E15]
- Public Microsoft documentation describes Windows kernel-mode managers/libraries (Object/Memory/Process/I/O/PnP/Power/Security managers, Executive, HAL), but this source set does not provide full internal implementation detail; this comparison is therefore limited to what Microsoft publicly documents.[E14][E27][E28][E29]
- For mature open-source families, documentation confirms broad subsystem depth for FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD; illumos evidence here is scoped to an AArch64 port design document; Redox direct docs were blocked in this environment, so Redox claims are constrained and marked where uncertain.[E16][E17][E18][E19][E20][E23][E24][E25]

## Methodology And Sourcing Policy
- Primary-source-first policy: repo files for Rugo, official project/vendor docs for other OSes, with secondary fallback only when primary access was blocked.[R1][R2][R3][R4][R5]
- Every factual statement is cited. If evidence is missing, the statement is marked `Unknown (I cannot confirm this)`.[R4]
- No performance/stability/security/hardware-completeness claims are made without source evidence.[R4][R5]
- Repo-derived Rugo claims in this refresh were rechecked against current README/status/milestone files and M47 hardware support-policy documents on 2026-03-11; external comparison sources below remain the 2026-03-04 access set.[R1][R2][R3][R24][R25][R26]
- Access limitations encountered in this run:
  - Fedora docs URLs in the requested set were blocked by Anubis challenge; Fedora package metadata and DNF upstream docs were used instead (Fedora package page is primary, DNF docs are primary for the tool, not a distro policy source).[E10][E11][E26]
  - `freedesktop.org` systemd man page returned `403`; upstream systemd man source from project repository was used as fallback.[E14][E27]
  - Redox official site/book endpoints returned `403`; Redox data here is restricted to available Redox book structure evidence and clearly labeled where confidence is lower.[E23][E24][E25]

## What Rugo Is Today
- Kernel architecture summary: Rugo is documented as a Rust `no_std` kernel with a thin x86-64 assembly entry layer, while policy/services are placed in Go user-space; a legacy C lane is preserved separately as a fallback/reference.[R1][R2][R3][R10][R19]
- Boot path summary: boot config points Limine at `boot/kernel.elf`; `_start` sets stack and calls `kmain`; image generation copies vendored Limine BIOS artifacts and runs `limine-cli bios-install`.[R9][R10][R11][R20]
- Syscall and service boundary summary: ABI v0 uses `int 0x80`, fixed register convention, explicit syscall table (`0..17` documented), and service-facing syscalls for IPC/SHM/service-registry/block/net are defined with constraints and error behavior.[R6]
- Networking and filesystem status summary: networking v0 is VirtIO-net + kernel-side ARP/IPv4 UDP echo with explicit "not implemented" list; filesystem v0 is SimpleFS with fixed on-disk layout, no journaling, and kernel-orchestrated fsd/pkg/sh flow.[R7][R8][R6]
- Hardware support posture summary: support matrix v6, bare-metal I/O baseline v1, support-claim policy v1, bare-metal promotion policy v2, and support-tier audit v1 define claimable Tier 1 virtual-platform classes and Tier 2 bare-metal qualification classes, while unsupported classes remain explicit and non-claiming.[R2][R3][R24][R25][R26]
- Testing approach summary: Rugo uses marker-based QEMU acceptance tests via pytest fixtures that boot variant ISOs and assert deterministic serial markers; top-level make targets now wire milestone-specific gates across runtime/network/storage/release/security/pkg/hw domains, including the M47 claim-promotion and support-tier audit gates.[R1][R2][R3][R12][R13][R14][R15][R22][R23][R24][R25][R26]

## Deep Dives By OS Family

### A) Linux Upstream Kernel
- Scheduler: CFS is documented as vruntime-driven and rbtree-based fair scheduling; this provides a strong reference model for fairness semantics and observability.[E1]
- Memory model: Linux docs describe hierarchical page tables, demand paging, huge pages, and explicit page-fault/OOM paths.[E2][E3]
- Driver model: Linux documents a unified driver model with common bus/device abstractions and userspace visibility via sysfs.[E4]
- ABI posture: syscall design guidance explicitly treats syscall API as long-lived and calls out extension-planning patterns; ABI docs state most interfaces like syscalls are expected never to change.[E5][E6]
- Practical relevance for Rugo: Rugo already documents ABI constraints and feature gates; adopting Linux-like extension discipline (flags/struct sizing/selftests/man-page-first) is directly aligned with current Rugo contract style.[R6][E5]

### B) Linux Distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, NixOS, Gentoo)
- Debian: documents APT frontends and `dpkg` as the low-level package tool; command mappings (`apt update/install/upgrade`) are explicit.[E8]
- Ubuntu: server docs use APT workflow and explicitly note `apt` interactive vs `apt-get` for scripting.[E9]
- Fedora: requested Fedora docs URL was blocked in this environment; Fedora package metadata confirms DNF role, and DNF upstream docs confirm command/transaction model.[E10][E11][E26]
- Arch: pacman manual documents dependency-aware sync/upgrade operations and `libalpm` backend.[E12]
- NixOS: manual describes declarative package management and `nixos-rebuild`-based upgrade/switch workflows, plus explicit systemd integration patterns.[E13]
- Gentoo: Portage/emerge documentation describes source-driven package workflow and Portage configuration surfaces.[E15]
- Practical relevance for Rugo: distro differentiation in this source set is mostly packaging/update discipline, not kernel internals; Rugo can borrow update/repo/client mechanics while keeping kernel ABI/contracts independently controlled.[R1][R2][E8][E9][E10][E11][E12][E13][E15]

### C) Windows (Publicly Documented NT Kernel/Driver Model)
- Microsoft docs enumerate kernel-mode managers (Object/MM/Process+Thread/I/O/PnP/Power/Config/Security), plus core libraries (Kernel, Executive support, HAL).[E27][E28][E29]
- Executive support library scope is explicitly defined as kernel-mode service layer and notes component boundaries relative to drivers/HAL.[E28]
- HAL docs define hardware abstraction purpose and expose HAL routines (`Hal*`) rather than custom HAL implementation by driver developers.[E29]
- Scope limitation: this comparison intentionally uses only public documentation; deeper internals remain out of scope here.[E27][E28][E29]
- Practical relevance for Rugo: keep manager-layer boundaries and explicit syscall/driver contracts documented early, as Rugo already does for several milestones.[R2][R6]

### D) Mature Open Source OS Families (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos, Redox, ReactOS)
- FreeBSD: architecture handbook presents explicit kernel/device-driver chaptering, including boot, VM, locking, MAC, jail, and driver frameworks.[E16]
- OpenBSD: FAQ structure foregrounds security updates, package management, and operational guidance for current release docs.[E17]
- NetBSD: kernel docs and guide include kernel build/debug resources, `rc.d` system documentation, and security-oriented sections (e.g., Veriexec chapter in guide TOC).[E18][E19]
- illumos: extracted source is IPD24 (AArch64 support) with explicit ABI/platform assumptions and Arm SystemReady target framing; this is narrower than full illumos architecture coverage.[E20]
- Redox: primary Redox book/site endpoints were blocked; available evidence confirms documented architecture topic areas (microkernel, user-space services, scheduling, memory, drivers, RedoxFS, security, package management), but implementation status cannot be fully confirmed here.[E23][E24][E25]
- ReactOS: architecture page and FAQ define an open-source Windows-compatible NT-oriented design, including NT kernel component targets and explicit project maturity caveats.[E21][E22]

## Dimension-By-Dimension Tradeoffs

### 1) Kernel architecture and modularity
- Rugo now: hybrid Rust-kernel/Go-services boundary with a preserved legacy lane.[R1][R2]
- Other OS state: Linux/Windows/FreeBSD/ReactOS sources document mature manager- or framework-oriented decomposition.[E1][E4][E16][E27][E21]
- Tradeoff (inference): Rugo's smaller, contract-driven architecture improves clarity and testability, while mature systems provide broader subsystem depth and compatibility surface.[R2][E1][E16][E27]
- Practical takeaway (inference): keep strict boundaries and add subsystems only behind documented ABI/tests.

### 2) Boot process and loader assumptions
- Rugo now: Limine config + deterministic image assembly + `_start` to `kmain` path is explicit.[R9][R10][R11]
- Other OS state: FreeBSD boot stages are explicitly documented; illumos AArch64 doc is platform/firmware-profile driven.[E16][E20]
- Tradeoff (inference): explicit boot-chain documentation reduces ambiguity but requires ongoing maintenance as targets broaden.
- Practical takeaway (inference): preserve boot contracts as versioned artifacts, especially when adding non-QEMU targets.

### 3) Process/thread/scheduling model
- Rugo now: cooperative user-thread semantics are explicitly documented in ABI v0.[R6]
- Other OS state: Linux CFS and ReactOS NT scheduler components are explicitly documented at architecture level.[E1][E21]
- Tradeoff (inference): cooperative models simplify early correctness; preemptive fairness models scale better for mixed workloads.
- Practical takeaway (inference): freeze semantics for current model, then evolve with compatibility tests.

### 4) Memory management model
- Rugo now: paging enablement and bounded `vm_map/vm_unmap` behavior are explicitly contractized.[R2][R6]
- Other OS state: Linux documents hierarchical page tables, faults, huge pages; FreeBSD/NetBSD docs indicate deep VM subsystems.[E2][E3][E16][E18]
- Tradeoff (inference): Rugo's constrained VM model is easier to verify now, but less feature-rich than mature kernels.
- Practical takeaway (inference): extend VM features through additive, tested contracts.

### 5) Driver model and hardware enablement
- Rugo now: support matrix v6, bare-metal I/O baseline v1, and M47 claim-policy/audit contracts define claimable Tier 1 virtual-platform classes and Tier 2 bare-metal classes with an explicit unsupported registry.[R2][R3][R24][R25][R26]
- Other OS state: Linux unified model, Windows HAL/WDM guidance, and BSD driver documentation indicate broader hardware frameworks.[E4][E27][E29][E16]
- Tradeoff (inference): Rugo gains determinism and faster validation but has intentionally narrower hardware coverage.
- Practical takeaway (inference): continue matrix-first expansion and keep support claims tied to explicit tier promotion, qualifying profiles, and audits.

### 6) System call surface and ABI stability approach
- Rugo now: syscall numbers/register ABI and freeze/no-breaking window are explicit.[R6]
- Other OS state: Linux docs require extension planning and treat syscall API as long-lived; ABI docs set strong stability expectations.[E5][E6]
- Tradeoff (inference): strict freeze windows slow change but improve ecosystem confidence.
- Practical takeaway (inference): keep freeze windows and compatibility gates tied to release milestones.

### 7) Filesystem model and storage stack
- Rugo now: SimpleFS v0 is minimal and documented; v0 scope excludes journaling.[R8]
- Other OS state: FreeBSD docs indicate mature VM/filesystem-I/O layering; ReactOS/Redox docs indicate storage-focused architecture areas but with varying source confidence.[E16][E21][E23]
- Tradeoff (inference): a minimal FS improves bring-up speed but limits fault-tolerance and broader workload support.
- Practical takeaway (inference): evolve from v0 via explicit durability/recovery contracts (already aligned with M13 docs).
### 8) Networking stack and userland networking tools
- Rugo now: UDP echo v0 profile is intentionally narrow and fully documented with exclusions.[R7]
- Other OS state: OpenBSD/NetBSD/FreeBSD sources show mature operational/network documentation footprints.[E17][E19][E16]
- Tradeoff (inference): narrow protocol scope increases determinism but limits interoperability breadth.
- Practical takeaway (inference): keep model-based interop/soak gating before adding protocol surface.

### 9) Security model
- Rugo now: rights model, syscall filtering, secure-boot/signing controls, hardening v3, vulnerability-response, and evidence-integrity gates are documented as done milestones.[R2][R3][R6]
- Other OS state: Linux exposes documented user-facing security interfaces; Windows documents Security Reference Monitor; BSD docs foreground security framework/update posture.[E7][E27][E16][E17][E19]
- Tradeoff (inference): Rugo's explicit policy contracts are a strong foundation; mature systems have broader battle-tested ecosystems.
- Practical takeaway (inference): prioritize policy invariants and failure-mode tests over feature volume.

### 10) Userspace model (init/services/IPC)
- Rugo now: service boundary is Go-oriented with IPC/service-registry contracts, service/init v2 closure, and later process/readiness compatibility evidence.[R2][R3][R6][R22][R23]
- Other OS state: NixOS docs explicitly show systemd integration; NetBSD guide documents `rc.d`; ReactOS documents core privileged system processes.[E13][E19][E21]
- Tradeoff (inference): Rugo's explicit service boundary helps portability goals but requires disciplined ABI stabilization.
- Practical takeaway (inference): maintain service contracts as first-class API artifacts.

### 11) Packaging, updates, and distribution mechanics
- Rugo now: package/repo ecosystem, update-trust, distribution workflow, release lifecycle, and recovery/update documents are integrated in later milestone closure and gates.[R1][R2][R3]
- Other OS state: distro docs provide mature package-manager workflows (APT, DNF, pacman, Nix, Portage).[E8][E9][E10][E11][E12][E13][E15]
- Tradeoff (inference): mature package ecosystems are feature rich; Rugo's contract-first release/update path can offer stronger traceability if maintained.
- Practical takeaway (inference): keep update metadata verification and rollback protections as non-optional gates.

### 12) Tooling and developer workflow
- Rugo now: make-driven multi-image build/test workflows with QEMU/pytest and cross-domain gates are explicit, now extending through M47 hardware claim-promotion and support-tier audit checks.[R1][R2][R3][R12][R13][R21][R24][R25][R26]
- Other OS state: Linux syscall process explicitly requires selftests and man-page work; ReactOS and BSD/NetBSD docs provide contributor workflows and references.[E5][E16][E18][E19][E21][E22]
- Tradeoff (inference): contract-heavy workflows increase engineering overhead but reduce ambiguity and regression risk.
- Practical takeaway (inference): keep tooling outputs machine-readable and tied to release criteria.

### 13) Governance and release engineering
- Rugo now: release policy, support lifecycle, supply-chain revalidation, evidence integrity, and update-signing docs are part of later milestone closure through M47.[R1][R2][R3]
- Other OS state: sources here provide varying governance visibility (strong documentation in BSD families; predraft status in illumos AArch64 IPD doc).[E16][E17][E19][E20]
- Tradeoff (inference): explicit release governance increases process burden but improves reliability of claims.
- Practical takeaway (inference): continue milestone-to-gate traceability and keep policy docs versioned with tests.

### 14) Maturity signals
- Rugo now: milestone matrix reports full completion through M47/G2, with M45-M47 recorded as the latest completed hardware expansion phase.[R1][R2][R3]
- Other OS state: Linux/BSD/Windows/ReactOS sources indicate broad architecture documentation depth; Redox source access in this run was limited.[E1][E16][E17][E18][E21][E22][E23][E25]
- Tradeoff (inference): Rugo has strong evidence discipline for its scale; mature ecosystems still exceed it in breadth and historical depth.
- Practical takeaway (inference): preserve evidence rigor while widening compatibility and hardware scope incrementally.

## Gaps And Risks For Rugo (Mapped To GAP_REPORT And MILESTONES)
| Risk | Evidence mapping | Why it matters | Guardrail |
|---|---|---|---|
| ABI churn risk during active freeze window | Syscall v0 freeze rules/timebox are explicit (`2026-03-03` start; no breaking in freeze window).[R6] | Breaking syscall contracts would invalidate current compatibility assumptions and tests. | Keep ABI changes post-freeze and behind v1+ compatibility gates. |
| Regression risk on recently closed hardening items | GAP report marks pointer-safety and IPC/service-registry semantics items as resolved with tests.[R4] | Regressions can silently re-open already-closed correctness/security paths. | Keep these tests mandatory in `test-qemu` and CI release gates. |
| Toolchain coupling risk for full test entrypoint | Build docs state Go/TinyGo requirements for full test lane.[R5] | Missing/pinned tool mismatches can mask regressions or block reproducible validation. | Preserve explicit version pins and reproducibility checks in CI and docs. |
| Lane divergence / artifact overwrite risk | Milestones note both lanes writing into shared `out/` artifacts.[R2] | Cross-lane overwrite can produce false confidence during comparative testing. | Use isolated output dirs for concurrent lane verification. |
| Scope risk from bounded hardware claim policy | Support claim policy v1 and support-tier audit v1 constrain claimable classes to explicit Tier 1 and Tier 2 registries with qualifying evidence bundles.[R24][R25][R26] | Hardware claims beyond the declared registry would invalidate the audit model and overstate real support. | Keep hardware claims constrained to declared tiers, qualifying profiles, and audited artifacts. |

## Differentiation Opportunities For Rugo (Evidence-Grounded)
- Contract-first kernel/user boundary plus explicit freeze policy and support-claim audit model can become a core reliability differentiator if continuously enforced.[R6][R2][R24][R25][R26]
- Multi-domain milestone gates now span runtime/network/storage/security/pkg/release/hardware claim promotion; this provides a stronger evidence trail than many hobby OS projects and can be productized as "verifiable progress" reporting.[R2][R3][R12]
- Security model documentation plus automated hardening/vulnerability-response/evidence-integrity gating is already integrated and can be expanded into compatibility-profile security levels.[R2][R3][R6]
- Reproducible build checks (`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, hash compare) and signed-update workflows are already present; these are strong supply-chain posture anchors at small-project scale.[R5][R2]
