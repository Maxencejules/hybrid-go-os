# Expansion And Breadth Backlog Closure

This document covers the completed backlog milestones that broaden
compatibility, hardware claims, packaging scope, and desktop surface.

Most of these milestones are useful, but most of them are also the easiest to
close from contracts, deterministic models, and CI gates without materially
changing the default runtime. The tables below spell out what would still need
to exist before each breadth claim is literal.

## X1: Compatibility Surface Expansion

| Backlog | Current class | Current repo reading | Literal implementation target | Still required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `M8 Compatibility Profile v1` | `Runtime-backed` | The default lane now loads real ELF payloads for the external package path and proves file plus loader behavior through the runtime compatibility corpus. | A declared compatibility subset runs real external programs on the default lane with stable loader, process, file, and socket behavior. | Extend the same real-binary corpus as more supported APIs graduate, but do not broaden claims without new runtime-backed programs. |
| `M17 Compatibility Profile v2` | `Runtime-backed` | The v2 lane is now tied to a real-ELF runtime corpus instead of only richer contracts and gate models. | The supported compatibility profile is wider in the actual runtime, not only in the documents. | Keep loader, signal, fd, and error-surface growth attached to the same runtime-backed lane before raising profile scope. |
| `M27 External App Compatibility Program v3` | `Runtime-backed` | Tiering and class matrices now sit beside representative real ELF apps that launch on the default lane and through the package bootstrap path. | The declared app tiers launch and behave on the real system with packaging, lifecycle, and failure reporting that users can consume. | Add more representative third-party binaries before widening tier claims beyond the bounded runtime corpus. |
| `M36 Compatibility Surface Expansion v1` | `Runtime-backed` | The milestone now pairs compatibility and POSIX accounting with a live runtime corpus that exercises loader, file, socket, and readiness paths. | The OS actually exposes the additional process, file, socket, and readiness surfaces that the profile claims. | Keep deferred behavior explicit in code and extend the real corpus whenever new supported surfaces are added. |
| `M41 Process + Readiness Compatibility Closure v1` | `Runtime-backed` | Fork, clone, epoll, and readiness behavior are now checked at the ABI boundary by real ELF probes in addition to the contract suites. | The runtime either implements these surfaces or rejects them with consistent, documented behavior at the ABI boundary. | Only replace the stable non-support path when a real runtime implementation and corpus coverage exist. |

## X2: Hardware, Firmware, And Driver Breadth

| Backlog | Current class | Current repo reading | Literal implementation target | Still required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `M9 Hardware enablement matrix v1` | `Evidence-first` | The repo tracks support tiers and matrix docs, but the visible runtime still centers on QEMU-friendly VirtIO bring-up. | The system boots and exercises declared hardware classes with driver behavior that matches the published matrix. | Add real device probes, driver init paths, target-specific boot evidence, and support claims that reflect actual driver availability. |
| `M15 Hardware Enablement Matrix v2` | `Evidence-first` | Matrix v2 broadens policy and evidence, not visible driver substance. | More device classes become truly bootable and supportable. | Implement or integrate additional drivers, exercise them on the declared targets, and keep the matrix anchored to real probe and I/O results. |
| `M23 Hardware Enablement Matrix v3` | `Evidence-first` | Firmware attestation and hardware contracts grew, but runtime support breadth remains thin. | Hardware and firmware claims are backed by real boot validation, measured boot flow, and device operation on supported targets. | Tie measured-boot and firmware checks into the actual boot path, capture target-specific logs, and prove the claimed device classes on real or hardware-faithful platforms. |
| `M37 Hardware Breadth + Driver Matrix v4` | `Evidence-first` | Driver lifecycle and promotion policies are present, but there is no equally broad visible driver subsystem in the kernel. | The kernel has a real driver lifecycle with probe, bind, recover, detach, and negative-path handling across supported devices. | Add a driver core, device registry, probe ordering, fault handling, and target-specific regression suites driven by the booted system. |
| `M43 Hardware/Firmware Breadth + SMP v1` | `Evidence-first` | SMP, ACPI, firmware hardening, and native-driver breadth are mostly contract and test surfaces. | The kernel brings up multiple CPUs, validates firmware tables, routes interrupts correctly, and runs declared hardware classes under that model. | Implement AP bring-up, interrupt routing, firmware parsing, native-driver scaffolding, and SMP-safe scheduler or driver behavior. |
| `M45 Modern Virtual Platform Parity v1` | `Evidence-first` | The milestone mostly expresses modern VirtIO platform qualification as a shadow gate. | Modern virtual platforms are supported by the real runtime, not only qualified on paper. | Implement the missing modern VirtIO transport and device behavior, prove boot and I/O on those targets, and narrow the parity claim until that exists. |
| `M46 Bare-Metal I/O Baseline v1` | `Evidence-first` | Wired NIC, USB input, and removable-media support are documented and tested as contracts, not as a visibly complete runtime path. | The OS can use baseline bare-metal network, input, and removable-media hardware in the live system. | Add the actual NIC, xHCI or HID, and removable-media drivers, then route those events through the default service or desktop lanes. |
| `M47 Hardware Claim Promotion Program v1` | `Process-backed` | Promotion and audit policy is the product here, but it currently audits a still-thin hardware runtime. | Support claims are promoted only after real boot, install, suspend, resume, I/O, and recovery campaigns on the target tier. | Tie promotion to reproducible device runs, keep auditable evidence per platform, and do not promote hardware that lacks a real driver stack. |

## X3: Platform And Ecosystem Feature Breadth

| Backlog | Current class | Current repo reading | Literal implementation target | Still required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `M26 Package/Repo Ecosystem v3` | `Runtime-partial` | The repo has package and repo contracts, and the early lane can demonstrate a basic package flow, but not a broad ecosystem. | The system has a real repository client or server flow, reproducible packages, trust rotation, and update behavior used by the default lane. | Turn package handling into a full service path, implement signed metadata and key rotation in the live updater, and support non-trivial package catalogs. |
| `M38 Storage + Platform Feature Expansion v1` | `Evidence-first` | Snapshots, resize, advanced fs ops, and platform feature profiles are mostly modeled rather than visibly implemented. | The filesystem and platform layers support the claimed advanced features in the real runtime. | Add snapshot, resize, xattr, reflink, and capability-negotiation behavior to the actual storage and service layers, then validate them on real media. |
| `M39 Ecosystem Scale + Distribution Workflow v1` | `Evidence-first` | Catalog scale and distribution workflows are described through deterministic simulations. | The repo supports a real package catalog, distribution flow, and audit trail at the declared scale. | Build the catalog backend, distribution and replication logic, install telemetry, and rollback-safe promotion flow, then measure them on a real package corpus. |

## X4: Desktop And Workflow Breadth

| Backlog | Current class | Current repo reading | Literal implementation target | Still required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `M35 Desktop + Interactive UX Baseline v1` | `Evidence-first` | Desktop, display, input, and window baselines are heavily contract-driven, with no equally visible runtime stack in the kernel or Go lane. | The system can start a real interactive desktop session with display, input, windows, and basic GUI behavior. | Build the display and input runtime, surface management, and session lifecycle, then boot into that path by default when the desktop profile is selected. |
| `M44 Real Desktop + Ecosystem Qualification v2` | `Evidence-first` | The repo qualifies bounded desktop workflows, not a broad end-user desktop. | A real desktop session can launch, render, manage files, and host supported GUI apps on the declared targets. | Add application lifecycle, settings, file chooser, toolkit integration, and persistent desktop session behavior backed by the real runtime stack. |
| `M48 Display Runtime + Scanout v1` | `Evidence-first` | Display and scanout contracts exist without an obvious display runtime in the shipping lane. | The kernel and desktop stack can drive scanout on supported virtual or physical display devices. | Implement framebuffer or GPU-backed scanout, mode selection, frame pacing, and fallback logic that the desktop stack actually uses. |
| `M49 Input + Seat Management v1` | `Evidence-first` | Seat and HID behavior is represented in tests and docs, not a clearly visible runtime input stack. | Keyboard, pointer, hotplug, and seat routing work in the live system with consistent focus semantics. | Implement HID ingestion, input routing, seat ownership, focus management, and hotplug recovery in the desktop runtime. |
| `M50 Window System + Composition v1` | `Evidence-first` | Window lifecycle and compositor damage policies are contract surfaces today. | The desktop stack manages windows, composition, damage, focus, and resize or move semantics in real time. | Build surface allocation, scene composition, z-ordering, damage tracking, and client-facing window protocols. |
| `M51 GUI Runtime + Toolkit Bridge v1` | `Evidence-first` | GUI runtime, toolkit, and font contracts exist without a visible GUI runtime implementation. | Supported toolkits can render, process events, and interoperate with the OS window and input stack. | Implement event loops, drawing primitives, font and text rendering, toolkit bridge APIs, and failure handling for GUI apps. |
| `M52 Desktop Shell + Workflow Baseline v1` | `Evidence-first` | Desktop shell and graphical installer workflows are currently expressed through contract and workflow tests. | The OS ships a working shell, launcher, settings path, and bounded graphical workflows on top of the desktop runtime. | Build the shell and workflow apps, connect them to the real display, input, package, and storage services, and validate the installer on the actual graphical stack. |

## Cross-Cutting Closure Work

- Define the declared supported targets first. Breadth milestones only become
  meaningful when the repo says which hardware, virtual platforms, and desktop
  profiles are actually in scope.
- Build reusable subsystems instead of milestone-specific models. Driver core,
  input stack, display stack, package service, and compatibility layer work
  should each land once in the runtime and then be reused by many milestones.
- Keep breadth milestones subordinate to the core lane. A new matrix, desktop,
  or compatibility doc should not be mistaken for proof that the default hybrid
  OS is broadly complete.
