# Tooling And Release Backlog Closure

This document covers the backlog-bearing milestones that map into the tooling,
validation, release, and process track.

For this track, docs, policy, and automation are legitimate implementation
surfaces. The important distinction is narrower: a process milestone can be
real without proving new runtime breadth, and some current closures still rely
too heavily on deterministic reports rather than on artifacts produced by the
booted system.

## T1: Experimental Go Port And ABI Qualification

| Backlog | Current class | Current repo reading | Literal implementation target | Still required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `G2 Full Go port` | `Evidence-first` | The repo treats the stock-Go lane as experimental and mostly proves artifact contracts, not a default or broad runtime path. | Stock Go boots as a first-class supported userspace lane with enough ABI surface to run non-trivial services. | Make stock Go boot on the default image, expand syscall and process coverage, port real services onto that lane, and keep the experimental label only if the runtime surface truly remains limited. |
| `M11 Runtime + toolchain maturity v1` | `Process-backed` | Toolchain and maturity docs plus gates exist, but the visible product story is still thin. | Supported toolchain versions, bootstrap steps, and host reproducibility are versioned and actually used to build shipping artifacts. | Turn the bootstrap rules into the normal build path, verify reproducibility across supported hosts, and keep toolchain breakage from silently drifting past the published policy. |
| `M21 ABI + API Stability Program v3` | `Process-backed` | ABI stability is documented and gated, but the runtime surface it governs is still relatively small. | Syscall and API compatibility windows are generated from real source-of-truth interfaces and enforced against real consumers. | Generate ABI diffs from the actual syscall tables and headers, version deprecations against shipped userspace, and attach breakage reports to the release flow. |

## T2: Observability, Performance, And Evidence Discipline

| Backlog | Current class | Current repo reading | Literal implementation target | Still required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `M24 Performance Baseline + Regression Budgets v1` | `Evidence-first` | Performance budgets and reports exist, but they are not yet a convincing picture of mixed-service runtime behavior. | Performance budgets are measured from real booted workloads on declared targets and gate releases when they regress. | Benchmark the actual default lane, cover CPU, memory, block, and network workloads together, and keep the budget source tied to the same image the repo ships. |
| `M29 Observability + Diagnostics v2` | `Evidence-first` | Observability and crash-dump contracts exist, but there is no obviously broad live trace, metrics, and dump pipeline in the default lane. | Kernel and Go services emit structured logs, traces, and crash artifacts that can be collected, symbolized, and correlated after failure. | Implement runtime event streams, crash capture, symbolization hooks, and cross-layer identifiers that survive reboots and service restarts. |
| `M40 Runtime-Backed Evidence Integrity v1` | `Evidence-first` | The milestone explicitly wants runtime-backed evidence, but the repo still has many synthetic and deterministic artifact generators. | Release gates are driven by evidence emitted from the running system with traceable provenance back to the exact build and boot instance. | Move evidence generation into live runtime probes, sign or digest-link the emitted artifacts, and reject gate inputs that were not produced by the booted system under test. |

## T3: Release And Recovery Infrastructure

| Backlog | Current class | Current repo reading | Literal implementation target | Still required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `M14 Productization + release engineering v1` | `Process-backed` | Release docs, reports, and gates exist, but the repo still lacks a visibly mature shipping image story. | The project builds versioned installable artifacts, promotes them through defined channels, and can reproduce a release from source and inputs. | Standardize the image pipeline, attach signed metadata and changelogs, and make the release process drive the artifacts users actually boot. |
| `M20 Operability + Release UX v2` | `Process-backed` | Operability is described and tested at the contract level, not yet as a broad operator experience on live systems. | Operators can inspect health, collect diagnostics, and perform supported release actions on real systems with the documented workflow. | Add real support-bundle commands, health inspection surfaces, and operator-safe release tooling that runs against the booted image. |
| `M30 Installer/Upgrade/Recovery UX v3` | `Evidence-first` | Upgrade and recovery workflows are modeled and gated, but the repo does not visibly expose a full installer or recovery product path. | The system can install, upgrade, recover, and roll back on supported targets with the promised UX and safety rules. | Implement the installer and recovery environment, validate rollback floors on real artifacts, and tie the UX claims to bootable media and actual state transitions. |
| `M31 Release Engineering + Support Lifecycle v2` | `Process-backed` | Branch, support-window, and supply-chain policies are present, which is useful, but support claims outrun the visible runtime breadth. | Release branches, support windows, SBOMs, provenance, and revalidation tasks are attached to real shipping releases. | Make the support policy operate on actual release trains, automate revalidation from shipped SBOMs and attestations, and ensure support claims only cover what the runtime truly supports. |

## T4: Hardening, Qualification, And Fleet Operations

| Backlog | Current class | Current repo reading | Literal implementation target | Still required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `M28 Security Hardening Program v3` | `Evidence-first` | Threat-model, hardening, fuzz, and response artifacts exist, but the runtime hardening surface is still limited. | The kernel and image have concrete hardening defaults, mitigations, and security workflows that the shipping lane actually uses. | Implement more hardening knobs in the runtime, prove they are enabled in shipped artifacts, and tie fuzz and attack evidence to the real code paths that matter most. |
| `M32 Conformance + Profile Qualification v1` | `Process-backed` | Profile qualification suites exist as deterministic contracts and reports. | Published product profiles are qualified against real target systems with reproducible pass or fail bundles. | Run the conformance bundles on real images and target classes, define who owns profile drift, and fail releases when promised profile behavior is not present. |
| `M33 Fleet-Scale Operations Baseline v1` | `Evidence-first` | Fleet and rollout behavior is currently simulated rather than exercised against a believable deployment control plane. | A real staged rollout path can monitor health, halt bad canaries, and coordinate rollback across multiple running instances. | Build the update coordinator, health telemetry ingestion, canary controller, and abort logic, then run them against a small but real multi-node lab. |
| `M34 Maturity Qualification + LTS Declaration` | `Process-backed` | The repo has maturity and LTS policy documents, but the runtime scope they cover is still bounded. | LTS claims rest on an explicit support matrix, release cadence, regression budgets, and security response obligations for the actual product surface. | Narrow the LTS claim to what is genuinely supported, prove the qualification bundle on that surface, and keep the declaration tied to shipped releases rather than to milestone count. |

## Cross-Cutting Closure Work

- Make release, provenance, performance, and observability artifacts originate
  from the same images and boot flows that the repo claims to ship.
- Convert policy docs into the default automation path. A policy that only
  exists in docs and isolated tests is not yet a release discipline.
- Keep experimental lanes clearly labeled. `G2` should not be mistaken for the
  default product state unless the runtime really reaches that bar.
