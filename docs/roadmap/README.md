# Roadmap Summary

This is the architecture-first roadmap view. Use it to understand direction.
Use [../../MILESTONES.md](../../MILESTONES.md) for the exhaustive completion
matrix and [../archive/README.md](../archive/README.md) for historical
execution records. Use
[../RUGO_V1_PRODUCT.md](../RUGO_V1_PRODUCT.md) for the bounded `v1` product
definition that turns the roadmap into a concrete shipping target. Use
[MILESTONE_FRAMEWORK.md](MILESTONE_FRAMEWORK.md) for the full three-track
taxonomy, old-to-new mapping, rename guidance, and archive/foreground rules.
Use
[implementation_closure/README.md](implementation_closure/README.md) for the
"what would literal implementation still require?" companion set covering the
completed execution backlogs.

## Current Phase

The active framing is now three tracks rather than one flat milestone ladder.

| Track | Role | Current phase |
|---|---|---|
| Core Hybrid OS | Main scoreboard. Measures the default Rust-kernel plus Go-service runtime itself. | `C3` done; `C4` done; `C5` done. |
| Tooling / Validation / Release Infrastructure | Secondary scoreboard. Measures confidence, qualification, release, and lifecycle discipline around the core lane. | `T4` complete; next is `T5 Advanced Trust and Compliance Infrastructure`. |
| Expansion / Research / Platform Breadth | Secondary scoreboard. Measures compatibility breadth, hardware breadth, desktop breadth, and ecosystem growth. | `X4` complete; next is `X5 Next-Wave Breadth Research`. |

## Implementation Closure Docs

These companion docs cover every backlog-bearing milestone already marked
`done` or `completed` in the flat ledger and translate those closures into a
literal implementation bar:

- [implementation_closure/README.md](implementation_closure/README.md)
- [implementation_closure/core_runtime.md](implementation_closure/core_runtime.md)
- [implementation_closure/tooling_and_release.md](implementation_closure/tooling_and_release.md)
- [implementation_closure/expansion_breadth.md](implementation_closure/expansion_breadth.md)
- [implementation_closure/next_wave_native.md](implementation_closure/next_wave_native.md)

The historical core-runtime backlog is closed in the ledger.
[implementation_closure/core_runtime.md](implementation_closure/core_runtime.md)
records `M10`, `M12`, `M13`, `M16`, `M18`, `M19`, `M22`, `M25`, and `M42` as
runtime-backed closures on the default lane.

The historical X2 hardware backlog is closed on a shared runtime-backed qualification lane.
[implementation_closure/expansion_breadth.md](implementation_closure/expansion_breadth.md)
records `M9`, `M15`, `M23`, `M37`, `M43`, `M45`, `M46`, and `M47` as
runtime-backed hardware closures through the X2 aggregate gate.

The historical X3 platform and ecosystem backlog is closed on a shared runtime-backed qualification lane.
[implementation_closure/expansion_breadth.md](implementation_closure/expansion_breadth.md)
records `M26`, `M38`, and `M39` as runtime-backed platform/ecosystem closures
through the X3 aggregate gate.

The historical X4 desktop and workflow backlog is closed on a shared runtime-backed qualification lane.
[implementation_closure/expansion_breadth.md](implementation_closure/expansion_breadth.md)
records `M35`, `M44`, and `M48-M52` as runtime-backed desktop/workflow
closures through the X4 aggregate gate.

## Observable Core Progress

The repo is closer to its goal only when the default lane can do more of the
following on declared baseline platforms:

- boot from firmware into the Rust kernel and enter Go user space
- run the default Go init/service/shell stack on native kernel primitives
- persist data and perform network I/O through the default service lane
- enforce the process, rights, and isolation model that those services depend on
- survive bounded soak, restart, and containment tests tied to that same lane

## Historical Core Backlog Order

This is the order the flat ledger used to close the historical core backlog.
It is not the same thing as the current runtime-backed scoreboard.

1. `M10` and `M16` closed first.
2. `M25` extended the existing manifest-driven runtime instead of opening a
   new lane.
3. `M12` and `M13` followed as the first connected and durable runtime
   expansions.
4. `M18` and `M19` closed later and are now reinforced by the same boot-backed
   default lane.
5. `M22` and `M42` now close the sequence with runtime-backed reliability and isolation.

## Track Summary

### Core Hybrid OS

- `C1` Kernel Mechanisms Baseline: `M0-M5`
- `C2` Default Go Service Bring-up: `M6`, `M7`, `G1`
- `C3` Contracted Service OS Runtime: `M10`, `M16`, `M25`
- `C4` Durable and Connected Runtime: `M12`, `M13`, `M18`, `M19`
- `C5` Reliable and Isolated Service OS: `M22`, `M42`
- `C6` Runtime Quality Under Load: future core target, likely fed by `M78`,
  `M79`

### Tooling / Validation / Release Infrastructure

- `T1` Supported Stock-Go Lane and ABI Qualification: `G2`, `M11`, `M21`
- `T2` Observability, Performance, and Evidence Discipline: `M24`, `M29`,
  `M40`

- `T4` Hardening, Qualification, and Fleet Operations: `M28`, `M32`, `M33`,
  `M34`

### Expansion / Research / Platform Breadth

- `X1` Compatibility Surface Expansion: `M8`, `M17`, `M27`, `M36`, `M41`
- `X2` Hardware, Firmware, and Driver Breadth: `M9`, `M15`, `M23`, `M37`,
  `M43`, `M45-M47`
- `X3` Platform and Ecosystem Feature Breadth: `M26`, `M38`, `M39`
- `X4` Desktop and Workflow Breadth: `M35`, `M44`, `M48-M52`

## Foreground vs Archive

Foreground:

- the three-track scoreboard
- the default Rust-kernel plus Go-service demo path
- the historical core backlog order for
  `M10/M16 -> M25 -> M12/M13 -> M18/M19/M22 -> M42`

Archive or de-emphasize:

- flat `M0-M52 done` headlines
- repeated checkpoint strings and latest-GUI callouts
- detailed execution backlogs and closure ledgers as the first impression

Supported or preserved:

- supported stock-Go lane work
- extended research roadmap details in `docs/POST_G2_EXTENDED_MILESTONES.md`
